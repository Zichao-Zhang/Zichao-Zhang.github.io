### About me
Greetings! My name is Zichao Zhang. I’m from Beijing, a wonderful city in China. I am expected to graduate from [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) with B.S. in Computer Engineering with University Honors in the Schreyer Honors College. [the Schreyer Honors College](https://www.shc.psu.edu/) After graduation, I am planning on pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the related fields. 

My research interest is programing language and security. I’m fortunate to work with [Dr. Danfeng Zhang](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~dbz5017/) for the past two years. Currently, I am working on localizing information flow errors in programs based on Bayesian reasoning. 

In addition to my academic interests, I also enjoy various outdoor activities such as mountain biking and snowboarding. I love the thrill of gravity and the challenge of picking a trail to follow as I rush down the hill. However, getting an adrenaline rush is not the only reason I love those sports. Nothing is as amazing as getting immersed in nature with friends, chatting and talking to each other all the time to strengthen the bond between us. It offers the easiest way to get together with old friends and make new ones who share the same interests.
